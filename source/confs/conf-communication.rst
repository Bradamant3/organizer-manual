Communications
==============

It's important to send emails to folks about various events.
You can combine some of these emails,
but it's often best to send around 7-10 total emails for the conference.

Emails to send
---------------

* Date Announcement
* Call for Proposals
* Ticket Prices
* Keynotes (if applicable)
* CFP reminder (1 week out)
* Proposals
* Auxilary events (Hike, Writing Day, Reception, Party)

Each email will continue to list additional sponsors added to the conference.
