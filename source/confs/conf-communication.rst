Communications
==============

It's important to send emails to folks about various events.
You can combine some of these emails,
but it's often best to send around 7-10 total emails for the conference.

Emails to send
---------------

* Date Announcement
* Call for Proposals
* Ticket Prices
* Keynotes (if applicable)
* CFP reminder (1 week out)
* Proposals
* Auxilary events (Hike, Writing Day, Reception, Party)

Each email will continue to list additional sponsors added to the conference.


How to send email
-----------------

We write up the emails to send and post them on out blog.
Generally it's best to send a tweet with the blog post,
and then wait an hour or two to send the email.
This gives folks time to spot errors so we can fix them before sending the email :)

Process
~~~~~~~

The process is:

* Create a new MailChimp campaign with the email title being the blog post title
* Copy HTML from the blog post
* Remove Post title & Header links from the blog post (Regex is ``<a class="headerlink" .+</a>`` for search & replace)
* Paste HTML into MailChimp "Code" editor
* Send a test email to yourself from MailChimp
* Once everything looks good, hit the **big button**
